# AssetTracking
This project is to track your asset details.
It can store Computer and Prone details. This can store up to n number of assets based on your choice.
Once the Assets are stored in the database, it also gives you option to view and track them in shorting order (by office and then by Purchase date)
It also derives the local currency exchange rate for Sweden, Denmark and US.
In case of your assets are approaching EOL, it also does colour coding (Red for Assets reaching 3 month to EOP and Yellow for Assets reaching 6 months time).
